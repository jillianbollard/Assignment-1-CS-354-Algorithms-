### C. Code or Content from External Websites

*Utilized*

- **Instance 1:**
    - **URL of Source: https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_classes.asp**
    - **How it was Used:** Used to help set up java classes still trying to refres my memory on the language. Used to look at . notation if using functions from a different class (my helper method class seperated from my main function class)
    - **Specific Part of Assignment Affected:** Initial set up of classes and files in the FullSearchAlgs file and SearchAlgs file by imbedding FullSearchAlgs class within main function of SearchAlgs class

    - **URL of Source: https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_arraylist.asp**
    - **How it was Used:** Used in the random search function to add the previously checked index values to a list so that if all indexes had been checked without finding the value -1 would be returned instead of waiting to hit 10M iterations and then return -2
    - **Specific Part of Assignment Affected:** Random search -1 return instance set up and ability to terminate function early to save time and money from running 10M times if list is only 10 items long and item does not exist within list
